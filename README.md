Modeling previous credit card transactions with knowledge about the ones that turned out to be fraudulent is part of the Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem. Thus, this approach is employed to determine the validity of a new transaction. Here, we want to identify all fraudulent transactions while reducing the number of fraudulent transactions that are incorrectly classified.
